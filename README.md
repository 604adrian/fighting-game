# A fighting game

A good ol' fashioned Kung Fu fighting game.

Play the game on GitHub pages: [https://604adrian.github.io/fighting-game/]

I made this game by following the Youtube tutorial posted by 'Chris Courses'. The tutorial video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&list=TLPQMjgwNjIwMjOseK3axPC-Wg&index=7).

All the graphics come from itch.io.

The background image is brullov's _Oak Woods - Environmental Asset_. Check out the itch page [here](https://brullov.itch.io/oak-woods).

The graphics for player one come from LuizMelo's _Martial Hero_. Check out the itch page [here](https://luizmelo.itch.io/martial-hero).

The graphics for player two come from LuizMelo's _Martial Hero 2_. Check out the itch page [here](https://luizmelo.itch.io/martial-hero-2).
